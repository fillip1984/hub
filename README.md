This is a landing page for my aws hosted site. From here, I'll link out to other applications I build and use.

## What is it

This will be a t3 app, using supabase for it's database, using sst.dev to build out aws resources needed to run it. See [Web Dev Cody](https://youtu.be/Szr5SNFBT3g) for a quick dive into what [sst.dev](https://sst.dev) can do and be used for.

## How this project was bootstrapped (t3 and sst)

* This is a t3 app, so you can follow [these instructions](https://create.t3.gg) to create your own t3 app
* Then, to deploy it to the cloud using sst, follow [these instructions](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs). And also watch this guy, [Web Dev Cody](https://youtu.be/Szr5SNFBT3g)
